There are 4 differnt tests you can get from this repository to perform on your Pi's CPU.
These files are Test-A,B,C,and D. Each file has a purpose and will cover specific 
areas on your CPU. Along with the 4 simple-based tests is a greater stress test,
called the Nitro-Test. This is ONLY reccommended for Raspberry Pi's with good 
power and cooling. You can change the Nitro-Test test time
by finding the duration- code strip
By default, Nitro-Test is set for 30s.
